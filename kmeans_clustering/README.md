## Customer Segmentation Project with K-means Clustering

## Overview
This repository presents the implementation of a customer segmentation analysis using K-means clustering. The project focuses on grouping retail store customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, the study aims to uncover distinct customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing customer information, including features like 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score.' The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the clustering model.

## Project Tasks
### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Standardized features for uniformity in analysis.
  
### 2. Optimal Cluster Determination:
- Implemented the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters.
  
### 3. K-means Clustering:
- Applied K-means clustering to group customers based on selected features.
  
### 4. Visualizations:
- Developed a 3D graph for visualizing clustered customer segments.
- Created pair plots and box plots to further analyze and interpret clusters.
  
### 5. Silhouette Analysis:
- Utilized silhouette scores to evaluate clustering quality.
